    GOLDEN RULE: Things that are accessed together should be stored together.
    Guidlines: 
      1. Simplicity: Would keeping the pieces of information together lead to a simpler data model and code? 
      2. Go Together: Do the pieces of information have a "has-a", "contains" or similar relationship? 
      3. Query Atomicity: Does the application query the pieces of information together?
      4. Update Complexity: Are the pieces of information updated together? 
      5. Archival: Should the pieces of information be archived at the same time?
      6. Cardinality: Is there a high cardinality (current or growing) in the child side of the relationship?
      7. Data Duplication: Would data duplication be too complicated to manage and undesired?
      8. Document size
      9. Document Growth
      10. Workload
      11. Individuality
